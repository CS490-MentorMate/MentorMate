## Overview

### Description
MentorMate is an iOS app that allows students to find and match with mentors/tutors around their area to help gain the best assistance in classes

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Educational 

- **Mobile:** This app will be made for a mobile platform particularly for iOS. Extension into a Web App could be a potential future plan. 

- **Story:** Matches students with relevant tutors of the courses they want to be tutored in. The app also provides a chat interface for students to chat with their matched tutors regarding classes.  

- **Market:** Only for tutors and students. 

- **Habit:** This app could be used to find tutors for classes. The chatting interface on the app proves to be a better alternative than sharing personal contact information. This would enable both students and tutors to use the app often for communication purposes.

- **Scope:** Students will be able to view tutor cards on their dashboard. A potential match or a right swipe would mean that the tutor is skilled at a course that the student needs help in. Per say, the app segregates users into two groups namely students and tutors.
